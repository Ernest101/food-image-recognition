# Project title: classification of fruits and vegetables with neural network

The big idea of program is recogniseing fruits and vegetables in pictures. I have prepared and trained few CNN models. The study contains full code in Python and shows result of work. It works in following schema:

    Python packages imports and functions definitons
    data proprocessing and model compiling
    CNN model training
    model's test
    plot of training history
    prediction on new picture using best model
